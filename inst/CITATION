              bioactivity screens available in the public domain, systematic
              leverage of the data to assess target druggability and compound
              selectivity has been confounded by a lack of suitable
              cross-target analysis software. We have developed bioassayR, a
              computational tool that enables simultaneous analysis of
              thousands of bioassay experiments performed over a diverse set of
              compounds and biological targets. Unique features include support
              for large-scale cross-target analyses of both public and custom
              bioassays, generation of high throughput screening fingerprints
              (HTSFPs), and an optional preloaded database that provides access
              to a substantial portion of publicly available bioactivity data.
              bioassayR is implemented as an open-source R/Bioconductor package
